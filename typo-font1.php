<b>IDEA</b><br><br>
The objective of the project was to create visual identifi-<br>cation for
a ceramic design festival. The patron of the event is Rafael Bordalo Pin-<br>heiro, 19th century illustra-<br>tor and graphic designer, who founded the ceramic factory in Caldas da Rainha in 1884.<br><br>
The idea for the visual iden-<br>tification came from a word -play with the patron’s name, which means a pine tree or a pine cone. That gives
a double meaning: the first refferes to the name: it’s Pinheiro’s festival;
but if the apostrophe is removed it gives “Pinheiros” - the mea-<br>ning
of pine trees or pine cones.<br>
That’s why I decided to build the visual identity on the image of
a pine cone.

<b>INVENTING the TYPEFACE</b><br><br>
I started from looking for inspiration in a pine forest, <br>I tried to find letter’s shapes<br> in that sorrounging. I found the idea to build letters on <br>a grid based on a pine cone as the most interesting. <br>I made several grids and built letters on one of them.
