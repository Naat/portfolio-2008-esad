<b>IDEA</b><br><br>
The objective of the project was to create visual identifi-<br>cation for
a ceramic design festival. The patron of the event is Rafael Bordalo Pin-<br>heiro, 19th century illustra-<br>tor and graphic designer, who founded the ceramic factory in Caldas da Rainha in 1884.<br><br>
The idea for the visual iden-<br>tification came from a word -play with the patron’s name, which means a pine tree or a pine cone. That gives
a double meaning: the first refferes to the name: it’s Pinheiro’s festival;
but if the apostrophe is removed it gives “Pinheiros” - the mea-<br>ning
of pine trees or pine cones.<br>
That’s why I decided to build the visual identity on the image of
a pine cone.

<b>INVENTING the TYPEFACE</b><br><br>
The other idea also came from cone - I simplified the shape of a cone seed and made a grid out of it. This grid was similar to pixel grid and I created font similarly to making a pixel font. The pattern-like look turned out to be good to use as a horizontal stripe with words. It’s both decorative and indicative - it leads the riders sight.
